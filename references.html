        <h1>REFERENCES AND CREDITS</h1>
        <p>All images are taken from different sources linked below. This result is a non-commercial task, and without
            being part of the work to document everything used, I have left it as a reminder that it is important to
            always credit any content, author, etc that is used (even contacting the creator to ask for permission to
            use it).</p>
        <p>The initial idea was more ambitious, to make tabs for all the links, so that the images become big when you
            click on them... but it requires much more time than I have to dedicate to the exercise.</p>
        <h4>The target of the task: One index, a gallery, a link to one item in the gallery and RSS option.</h4>
