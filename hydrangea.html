        <p>hydrangea, (genus Hydrangea), any of a genus of erect or climbing woody shrubs, in the family Hydrangeaceae,
            native to the Western Hemisphere and eastern Asia. About 23 species are known. Several species are grown in
            greenhouses and gardens for their showy, usually ball-like flower clusters.
            Hills-of-snow, or wild hydrangea (H. arborescens), a shrub slightly more than 1 metre (4 feet) tall, has
            rounded clusters of white flowers. The French hydrangea, or hortensia (H. macrophylla), is widely cultivated
            in many varieties for its large globular flower clusters in colours of rose, lavender, blue, and, rarely,
            white. These cultivated varieties are the florist’s hydrangeas, forced for holiday use. The flower colour is
            variable, depending on the acidity of the growing medium: rose-pink under neutral to low soil acidity and
            blue under conditions of stronger acidity. Blue flowers can be produced by the early addition of chemicals
            to increase the acidity of the growing medium.</p>
        <p>Peegee hydrangea (H. paniculata ‘Grandiflora’), growing to a height of 9 metres, is a common landscape
            hydrangea, with tapering flower clusters, opening white and fading to pink, then to bronze. Oakleaf
            hydrangea (H. quercifolia), up to 2 metres high, has white flower clusters and deep wine-red fall foliage.
            The climbing hydrangea (H. anomala petiolaris, or H. petiolaris), can reach up to 15 metres, clinging to any
            solid support by means of aerial rootlets.</p>
